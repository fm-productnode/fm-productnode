# Convertion of a BMEcat-2005 product catalog to the GoodRelations business entity ontology

The files in the subdirectories comprise two parts:

Thirst, in the *workplace/bmecat* directory there is a corrected BMEcat-2005 example product catalog.

Second, the task templates below *workplace/template/twig* accomplish the conversion of a BMEcat product catalog to the GoodRelations BusinessEntity class.

The BMEcat-2005 product catalog and the resulting RDF file company.rdf have a counterpart shown at the [BMEcat2GoodRelations example web page](http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/projects/bmecat2goodrelations/example/).

See my corresponding [Blog entry](https://blog.fm-productnode.de/entry/von-bmecat-in-das-semantische-web) for more details and explanations.
